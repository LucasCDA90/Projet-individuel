### How to play

**1. Objective :**
The objective of this game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21.

**2. Setup**
- The game starts with the player placing a bet.
- Shuffle the deck of cards.
- Players receive two cards and the dealer's first card is face up and the second is face down.

**3. Gameplay :**
- The player decides whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand).
- Players can also choose to "double down" (double their bet and receive one additional card) or "split" (if they have two cards of the same rank, split them into two separate hands).
- The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding it, or if the dealer busts (exceeds 21).

**4. End of the game :**
- At the end of each round, winnings are awarded or losses deducted based on the outcome.
- The game continues with new rounds until the player decides to quit or runs out of funds.
